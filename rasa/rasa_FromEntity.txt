    required_slots:
        departure_city:
          - type: from_entity
            entity: city
            role: from
          - type: from_entity
            entity: city
        arrival_city:
          - type: from_entity
            entity: city
            role: to
          - type: from_entity
            entity: city
        arrival_date:
          - type: from_entity
            entity: date

In the example above, an entity date uniquely sets the slot arrival_date, 
an entity city with a role from uniquely sets the slot departure_city 
and an entity city with a role to uniquely sets the slot arrival_city,
therefore they can be used to fit corresponding slots even if these slots were not requested.
However, entity city without a role can fill both departure_city and arrival_city slots,
depending which one is requested, so if an entity city isextracted when slot arrival_date is requested, it'll be ignored by the form.


理解:如果实体名唯一对应一个slot，若实体在form执行utter_ask_slot_name前已经提取到时，slot的值会自动填充，form不会再执行utter_ask_slot_name，
但如果实体名对应多个slot,即使实体在form执行utter_ask_slot_name前已经提取到，slot也不会自动填充，因为form不知道
应该对应哪个slot，此时还是会执行utter_ask_slot_name,如上例，form会依次执行utter_ask_arrival_city和utter_ask_departure_city
